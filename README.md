Projects from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem nand2tetris course

Projects folder contains all assignments done by me. If you are currently taking this course you can use it as an inspiration, but you should come to solutions on your own. 

All the necessary software tools and files are in tools folder. You don't need to install anything, all you need to do is to run .sh scripts. The folder contains:

1. Hardware Simulator
2. CPU Emulator
3. VMA Emulator
4. Assembler
5. Compiler
6. Operating System
7. Text Comparer
